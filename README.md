# ML_Final_Project
Project of Predicting the early readmission of the diabetes patient within 30 days of discharge.
* Predicting the early readmission of the diabetes patient within 30 days of discharge using the UCI
dataset: Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008. Using various statistical visualization such
as histogram, box-whisker plot, line chart to see the variation in patients age or times they came to
hospital could indicate the readmission. Preprocessing data, handling null values, detecting outliers
using box-whisker plot and quantile range. Applying feature selection which improved the overall
predicting ability of all testing algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient
Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression, KNN, and ANN with early stopping for reducing overfitting.
Moreover, using feature engineering by combining features to create a new attribute helped all models
increase accuracy from around 60-65% to around 79-81%. The algorithms with outstanding results
are Decision Tree and ANN with accuracy approximately 81%.
